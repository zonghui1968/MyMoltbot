# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Project Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Design Guidelines

- **Color Preference:** 避免蓝紫渐变色
- **Note:** 在开发前端项目时，配色方案中不要使用蓝紫色渐变

## CodeSpace Public URL

- **公网链接：** https://laughing-space-adventure-9p4v7x4jqxr3759g-18789.app.github.dev
- **工作流：** 每次完成开发后运行前端项目，发送公网链接给宗晖在手机上访问
- **注意：** 端口不要冲突

## GitHub Repository

- **Repository:** https://github.com/zonghui1968/MyMoltbot
- **Remote:** origin
- **Workflow:** Push changes after completing coding tasks

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
